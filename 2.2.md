The method outlined in 6, 7, 8 looks easiest because I don't need to separately convert to cartesian. I think I can sub in the 1 for the radius I want squared.
    - give u range r^2
    - sub 1's in sqrt for r^2
    
I'll loop over all the points, and then run them through my_chain.forward_kinematics to get the real end point of the arm for a given target. Then we should just be able to make a visualization with those points with plot_trisurf matplotlib.
